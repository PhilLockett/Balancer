Balancer
=====

'Balancer' is a command-line utility for balancing 'tracks' across multiple
'sides'.

This utility reads a text file containing a list of track lengths and titles
and splits them across multiple 'sides' based on the options provided.

A more generic description could be that it reads a list of values with labels
(tracks) and balances these across multiple containers (sides). Use the `-p`
option to display the values as integers.

Installing from tarball
-----------------------

The install process described in the INSTALL document is a generic 
description of the install process. The install process is also described 
in the README.md document. For completeness the install process is also 
described below. All three descriptions are essentially the same and clearly, 
it only needs to be installed once.

The install you will need a C++ compiler and make installed to compile 
'Balancer' from a release tarball. You will also need tar or equivalent 
installed. The following command will unpack the tarball:

    $ tar zxf Balancer-1.0.tar.gz

After unpacking, change to the top level directory, 'Balancer-1.0' and issue the 
following shell commands:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
